- 👋 Hi, I’m @Circuit-Meister
- 👀 I’m interested in inventing things for fun. I want to learn how to code Arduinoes and control motors to execute my imagination.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python but will move on to C++ as well as its Arduino variation.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on fun projects using the components I have.
- 📫 Not sure if you can contact me through Git Hub.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a dog.
